# Alexa Auto SDK

## About

The Alexa Auto SDK contains essential client-side software required to integrate Alexa into the automobile. The Auto SDK provides libraries that connect to Alexa and expose interfaces for your vehicle software to implement the platform-specific behavior for audio input, media streaming, calling through a connected phone, turn-by-turn navigation, controlling vehicle features such as heaters and lights, and more. You can use the included sample application to learn about the Auto SDK interfaces and to test interactions before integration.
