    direction: incoming
    desc: 
      Sets the Alexa `AudioPlayer` interface as the foreground player the user sees on screen. This message is useful 
      for scenarios in which the user played an `AudioPlayer` media source, then played a different Alexa-aware
      `ExternalMediaPlayer` media source, such as a deep-linked media app or a local media source, and then manually
      returned visual activity to the Alexa `AudioPlayer` GUI. This message ensures the next VUI command or
      GUI interaction with the playback control buttons acts on the `AudioPlayer` source rather than the more recently
      played `ExternalMediaPlayer` source.

      **Note:** The `AudioPlayer` had to be previously playing at least once during this Engine cycle in order for this message to make
      Alexa act on `AudioPlayer`.
