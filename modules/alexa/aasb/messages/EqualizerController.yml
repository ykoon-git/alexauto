  - action: GetBandLevels
    direction: outgoing
    desc: >
      Retrieves the current equalizer gain settings on the device for each supported band.

  - action: LocalSetBandLevels
    direction: incoming
    desc: >
      Notifies the Engine that gain levels for one or more equalizer bands are being set directly 
      on the device. If unsupported levels are provided, the Engine will truncate the settings to 
      the configured range.
    payload:
      - name: bandLevels
        type: list:EqualizerBandLevel
        desc: The equalizer bands to change and their gain settings as integer dB values.

  - action: SetBandLevels
    direction: outgoing
    desc: >
      Notifies the platform implementation to apply the provided gain settings to the corresponding 
      equalizer bands.

  - action: LocalAdjustBandLevels
    direction: incoming
    desc: >
      Notifies the Engine that relative adjustments to equalizer band gain levels are being made 
      directly on the device. If adjustments put the band level settings beyond the configured dB 
      range, the Engine will truncate the settings to the configured range.
    payload:
      - name: bandAdjustments
