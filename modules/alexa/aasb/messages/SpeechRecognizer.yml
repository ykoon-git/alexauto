      Notifies the Engine of a speech recognition event. The Engine will call startAudioInput() 
      to notify the platform implementation when to start writing audio samples. If the initator

      speech recognition on release of the press-and-hold action. Otherwise, the Engine will
      terminate the recognize event when end of speech is detected.
