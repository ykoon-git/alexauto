/**
 * CarControl should be extended to interface the elements that can be controlled in the vehicle. Each controllable
 * element is an 'endpoint' with a unique @c endpointId. @c CarControl provides interfaces for four types of
 * controllers. A custom combination of these controllers describes controls of the entire vehicle:
 *  @li Power Controller: Controls the power state of an endpoint. A maximum of one Power Controller is allowed per
 *      endpoint, identified by @c endpointId.
 *  @li Toggle Controller: Controls the power state of a particular setting of an endpoint. Multiple Toggle Controllers
 *      for unique settings are allowed per endpoint, each identified by the combination of @c endpointId and
 *      @c controllerId.
 *  @li Range Controller: Controls the settings of an endpoint that can be accessed with a range of values. Multiple
 *      Range Controllers for unique settings are allowed per endpoint, each identified by the combination of
 *      @c endpointId and @c controllerId.
 *  @li Mode Controller: Controls the settings of an endpoint that can be accessed with a set of modes. Multiple
 *      Mode Controllers for unique settings are allowed per endpoint, each identified by the combination of
 *      @c endpointId and @c controllerId.
 *
 * @deprecated This platform interface is deprecated.
 *             Use the Alexa Auto Services Bridge (AASB) message broker
 *             to publish and subscribe to AASB messages instead.
