# Wakeword Module

## Overview

This module manages 3rd party agent's wakeword detection via amazonlite supported wakeword engine in auto sdk" to indicate that it only manages the 3rd party agent's detection through its own Wakeword extension and not external. 


The [WakewordManager interface](https://alexa.github.io/alexa-auto-sdk/docs/aasb/core/WakewordManager) provides messages to

* Enable or Disable 3rd Party wakeword
* Notify the application when their wakeword is detected
